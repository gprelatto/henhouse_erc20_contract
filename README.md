# HenHouse ERC20 Contract

## What is HenHouse?

HenHouse is a Play to Earn game that features tokenized digital chickens in the BSC (Binance Smart Chain) network. We are incorporating the ERC-721 standard in order to keep the environment secure and with the last updates. Our players will be rewarded with BEP20 tokens that will be generated while they play the different game modes offered on our platform.

## Token Inflation

Token inflation will be avoided by restricting the maximum amount of tokens that we will supply. 
The total supply of tokens will be 50,000,000 during the period of time of 5 years. 
The token will be the game currency, and will be used for paying all the purchases inside the game or web platform. 
The token could be acquired by trading different cryptocurrencies and receiving the HENH tokens equivalent at the moment of trade.

## Halving System

In order to avoid inflation, the HENH tokens that are not released from the day 0 (44,000,000**) will be released with this schedule: 
During the first 90 days, HENH tokens will be distributed with a maximum of 88,000 tokens per day. 
From the day 91, HENH tokens will be distributed with a maximum of 44,000 tokens per day. 
From the day 181, HENH tokens will be distributed with a maximum of 22,000 tokens per day. 
Finally, from the day 271, HENH tokens will be distributed with a maximum of 20,000 tokens per day maintaining this schedule until we reach 5 years.

** 44,000,00 comes from the difference between Total Supply (50,000,000) and the sum of Air Drop (1,000,000) and Presale (5,000,000)
